    "# Identifying Similar Players Using Unsupervised Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using unsupervised nearest neighbors to compute searches for the nearest observations in the data, treating this as an approximation for a similarity score ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised nearest neighbors implements different algorithms for the task of finding the nearest neighbors (the nearest observations) for each sample. The scikit-learn implementation has three different algorithms that it applies, finding the best approach for the data: BallTree, KDTree, and Brute Force.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, neighbors-based methods find a set number of samples closest in distance to a new observation, and predict how to classify it from these nearest samples. The family of nearest neighbors algorithms are generally quite simple, but highly effective for a range of classification and regression tasks, and they form the basis for a number of more complicated approaches. In this case, the unsupervised approach can be repurposed and used to identify the nearest data points, representing the most similar players, without a follow-up task after.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've made the following assumptions/decisions in developing this solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I have taken the distance from all clusters to compute nearest neighbors. That way it doesn't just rely on the distance from its own cluster.\n",
    "- I've used the cluster distances from one season to compute the nearest neighbors, meaning that the function is identifying players that are similar to a player in a certain season, but there is also an argument to be made for using a player's mean distances over the course of all seasons for which there is data available for them.\n",
    "  - I've looked at the mean value similarities (taking the mean value of the individual, and then the single seeason value for similar players), and the results tend to be quite similar.\n",
    "  - It's possible that mean values should be used for both target and neighbors.\n",
    "  - It's not clear which is the better approach, but both are relatively easy to compute, so it's more of a conceptual decision than technical.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be possible to use the nearest neighbors approach on the raw player data, however, I think this would produce sub-optimal results. On its own this approach will potenially be too dependent on variables that may not define the broader role that a player is playing, but happen to define similarities between two players. Instead, the clustering approach classifies players in the wider context of the type of player they are, and then similarities can be drawn from that context."
